Welcome to my Introduction/info page on my milestone Project!

I want to give atleast a bit of an introduction to the game. 

I guess this is technically a game but in all reality, it's a bit different from your usual games.

In this game, there is no winning, losing, ties, and points.

Objective is essentially to mess around with the options available to you and have fun.

You can do as you please, as long as your computer has the "balls" do process everything.

                                               INSPIRATION FOR THE GAME  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is by no means on par with the game I am using for reference, but the link is to the game that i based the blueprint off of

                                                      ABOUT THE GAME  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To explain a bit more in detail about all of the options, I'll start at the beginning.

In a sense, its not your traditional game. It's more like a toy, like building a structure out of legos.

The balls have collision physics (basic but still) so they bounce off of each other and walls. 

You have the option to either press the button or your space bar to spawn in balls individually.

When they spawn in, you have the options to either increase or decrease the size of the ball.

on top of that, you also have the option to increase or decrease the speed and velocity of the ball.

Another feature is that you have the option of two color modes for all balls to follow, which are either the spasm mode or the rainbow mode.

Lastly, if you either filled the screen too much or would rather reset the board, you have the button to clear all of the balls from the screen and start over!

Hope ya enjoy!

                                                     CONTROLS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside of the actual buttons that you can use and click to have the functions work properly, there are also a set of controls 
made so the functions can be more easily used.

Here are the controls for the game:

ArrowUp: Increase Size
ArrowDown: Decrease Size
ArrowLeft: Slow down speed
ArrowRight: Accelerate speed
Delete: Clear Page
Enter: Spawn in while keeping in mind of the custom amount
Space: Spawn individual



G: Press n find out (its better if you already have balls in the box. The more balls, the better!)
