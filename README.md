I want to give atleast a bit of an introduction to the game. 

I guess this is technically a game but in all reality, it's a bit different from your usual games.

In this game, there is no winning, losing, ties, and points.

Objective is essentially to mess around with the options available to you and have fun.

You can do as you please, as long as your computer has the "balls" do process everything.

                                                      ABOUT THE GAME  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To explain a bit more in detail about all of the options, I'll start at the beginning.

The balls have collision physics (basic but still) so they bounce off of each other and walls. 

You have the option to either press the button or your space bar to spawn in balls individually.

When they spawn in, you have the options to either increase or decrease the size of the ball.

on top of that, you also have the option to increase or decrease the speed and velocity of the ball.

Another feature is that you have the option of two color modes for all balls to follow, which are either the spasm mode or the rainbow mode.

Lastly, if you either filled the screen too much or would rather reset the board, you have the button to clear all of the balls from the screen and start over!

Hope ya enjoy!
